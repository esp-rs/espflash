A library and command-line tool for flashing Espressif devices.

Supports the **ESP32**, **ESP32-C2/C3/C6**, **ESP32-H2**, **ESP32-S2/S3**, and **ESP8266**.

## Installation

If you are installing `espflash` from source (ie. using `cargo install`) then you must have `rustc>=1.70.0` installed on your system.

If you are running **macOS** or **Linux** then [libuv] must also be installed; this is available via most popular package managers. If you are running **Windows** you can ignore this step.

```bash
# macOS
brew install libuv
# Debian/Ubuntu/etc.
apt-get install libuv-dev
# Fedora
dnf install systemd-devel
```

To install:

```bash
cargo install espflash
```

Alternatively, you can use [cargo-binstall] to download pre-compiled artifacts from the [releases] and use them instead:

```bash
cargo binstall espflash
```

If you would like to flash from a Raspberry Pi using the built-in UART peripheral, you can enable the `raspberry` feature (note that this is not available if using [cargo-binstall]):

```bash
cargo install espflash --features=raspberry
```

### Permissions on Linux

In Linux, when using any of the commands that requires using a serial port, the current user may not have access to serial ports and a "Permission Denied" or "Port doesn’t exist" errors may appear.

On most Linux distributions, the solution is to add the user to the `dialout` group (check e.g. `ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0` to find the group) with a command like `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`. You can call `su - $USER` to enable read and write permissions for the serial port without having to log out and back in again.

Check your Linux distribution’s documentation for more information.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

It is _not_ currently possible to use `cargo-espflash` from within WSL1. There are no plans to add support for WSL1 at this time.

It is also _not_ possible to flash chips using the built-in `USB_SERIAL_JTAG` peripheral when using WSL2, because resetting also resets `USB_SERIAL_JTAG` peripheral, which then disconnects the chip from WSL2. Chips _can_ be flashed via UART using WSL2, however.

### Cargo Runner

You can also use `espflash` as a Cargo runner by adding the following to your project's `.cargo/config.toml` file, for example:

```toml
[target.'cfg(any(target_arch = "riscv32", target_arch = "xtensa"))']
runner = "espflash flash --baud=921600 --monitor /dev/ttyUSB0"
```

With this configuration you can flash and monitor you application using `cargo run`.

## Configuration File

It's possible to specify a serial port and/or USB VID/PID values by setting them in a configuration file. The location of this file differs based on your operating system:

| Operating System | Configuration Path                                                |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux            | `$HOME/.config/espflash/espflash.toml`                            |
| macOS            | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/rs.esp.espflash/espflash.toml` |
| Windows          | `%APPDATA%\esp\espflash\espflash.toml`                            |

### Configuration examples

You can either configure the serial port name like so:

```
[connection]
serial = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
```

Or specify one or more USB `vid`/`pid` couple:

```
[[usb_device]]
vid = "303a"
pid = "1001"
```
