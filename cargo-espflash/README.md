## Installation

If you are installing `cargo-espflash` from source (ie. using `cargo install`) then you must have `rustc>=1.85.0` installed on your system.

To install:

```bash
cargo install cargo-espflash --locked
```

Alternatively, you can use [cargo-binstall] to download pre-compiled artifacts from the [releases] and use them instead:

```bash
cargo binstall cargo-espflash
```

[releases]: https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/releases

### Permissions on Linux

In Linux, when using any of the commands that requires using a serial port, the current user may not have access to serial ports and a "Permission Denied" or "Port doesn’t exist" errors may appear.

On most Linux distributions, the solution is to add the user to the `dialout` group (check e.g. `ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0` to find the group) with a command like `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`. You can call `su - $USER` to enable read and write permissions for the serial port without having to log out and back in again.

Check your Linux distribution’s documentation for more information.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

It is _not_ currently possible to use `cargo-espflash` from within WSL1. There are no plans to add support for WSL1 at this time.

It is also _not_ possible to flash chips using the built-in `USB_SERIAL_JTAG` peripheral when using WSL2, because resetting also resets `USB_SERIAL_JTAG` peripheral, which then disconnects the chip from WSL2. Chips _can_ be flashed via UART using WSL2, however.

To be able to flash within WSL2, [systemd should be enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#systemd-support). To do so, create or edit `/etc/wsl.conf` using `sudo` for admin permissions and add the following:

```
[boot]
systemd=true
```

and then close the WSL distribution on Windows side using PowerShell to restart WSL instances:

```pwsh
wsl.exe --shutdown
```

For more information, please refer [here](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/issues/641#issuecomment-2408771592).

## Bootloader and Partition Table

`cargo-espflash` is able to detect if the package being built and flashed depends on [esp-idf-sys]; if it does, then the bootloader and partition table built by the `esp-idf-sys` build script will be used, otherwise the bundled bootloader and partition tables will be used instead.

If the `--bootloader` and/or `--partition-table` options are provided then these will be used regardless of whether or not the package depends on `esp-idf-sys`.

## Configuration Files

There are two configuration files allowing you to define various parameters for your application:

- `espflash.toml`: Project configuration
- `espflash_ports.toml`: Port configuration

The reason to split configuration into two different files is to allow Git ignoring the Serial Port configuration, which is specific to the user (see [#727](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/issues/727)).

### `espflash_ports.toml`

This file allows you to define the serial port connection parameters:
- By name:
  ```toml
  [connection]
  serial = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
  ```
- By USB VID/PID values:
  ```toml
  [[usb_device]]
  vid = "303a"
  pid = "1001"
  ```

### `espflash.toml`

This file allows you to define different flash parameters:
- Baudrate:
```toml
baudrate = 460800
```
- Bootloader:
```toml
bootloader = "path/to/custom/bootloader.bin"
```
- Partition table
```toml
partition_table = "path/to/custom/partition-table.bin"
```
- Flash settings
```toml
[flash]
mode = "qio"
size = "8MB"
frequency = "80MHz"
```

### Configuration Files Location
You can have a local and/or a global configuration file(s):

- For local configurations, store the file under the current working directory or in the parent directory (to support Cargo workspaces) with the name `espflash.toml`
- Global file location differs based on your operating system:
  - Linux: `$HOME/.config/espflash/espflash.toml` or `$HOME/.config/espflash/espflash_ports.toml`
  - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/rs.esp.espflash/espflash.toml` or `$HOME/Library/Application Support/rs.esp.espflash/espflash_ports.toml`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\esp\espflash\espflash.toml` or `%APPDATA%\esp\espflash\espflash_ports.toml`

### Configuration Precedence

1. Environment variables: If `ESPFLASH_PORT`, `MONITOR_BAUD` or `ESPFLASH_BAUD` are set, the will be used instead of the config file value.
2. Local configuration file
3. Global configuration file

## Logging Format

`cargo-espflash` `flash` and `monitor` subcommands support several logging formats using the `-L/--log-format` argument:

- `serial`: Default logging format
- `defmt`: Uses [`defmt`] logging framework. With logging format, logging strings have framing bytes to indicate that they are `defmt` messages.
  - See [`defmt` section] of `esp-println` readme.
  - For a detailed guide on how to use `defmt` in the `no_std` ecosystem, see [`defmt` project] of Embedded Rust (no_std) on Espressif book.

## Development Kit Support Policy

While in an ideal world we would aim to provide full support for all available development kits, this is unfortunately not achievable in practice. Instead, we aim to ensure full compatibility with all [official Espressif development kits].

We do not expect issues with third-party kits, however occasion issues do crop up. When this happens, if users expect fixes to be made then they are expected to debug the issue themselves so that a fix can be formulated; we cannot always reproduce these problems ourselves, and it's not reasonable to expect us to purchase every development kit users may experience issues with.
